# Shopify Logistics Backend

For the Shopify Backend Internship Challenge 2022.

##How to use?

All routing right now is done using ResponseEntities.  Going to add simple thymeleaf html files to have simple frontend UI.

Includes the sqlite file required for this project to function.  So you can just build it and it will work with a SQLite db connection.

Right now using Postman to verify routes are working as intended.
