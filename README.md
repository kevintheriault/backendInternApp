This is a simple CRUD application create in Java with Spring Boot and JPA.

All routing right now is done using ResponseEntities.  Going to add simple thymeleaf html files to have simple frontend UI.

Includes the sqlite file required for this project to function.  So you can just build it and it will work with a SQLite db connection.

Right now using Postman to verify routes are working as intended.
